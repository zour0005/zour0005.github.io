2. Reviewed both final demos the professor published for class.

### Overcomimg Challenges 

1. Took some long breaks to balance my energy to deal with issues
2. Reviewing Web Development II class learning materials 
3. Reviewing some online tutorials to help me

## What I learned

I learned by making a paln for what I will be coding from scratch and making a good structure in that plan everything, when
I am coding everything from scratch, completing it then can become easily and not taking long period of time to complete the
required work.
