        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>I am originally from Palestine but I was born in Doha and lived most of my life there, tell I was 18 years old. I went to a couple of different schools and the last one I moved to, which I completed my secondary level in it, was more enjoyable than the others.</p>
        <h3>Moving To Ottawa</h3>
        <p>I moved to <abbr title="Ottawa">OTT</abbr> about two years ago from my home country Qatar. I can remember seeing snow for my first<sup>1</sup> time in my life because I lived most my life in the Gulf where itâ€™s really warm there. The change of the climate for me at first was hard to accept but then as if nothing was hard to get used to.</p>
